# Appointment Planner - Codecademy

This project was created as part of Front-End Engineer Career path at Codecademy. 
I used functional react components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. 

The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments. 

I worked with stateful and stateless functional React components using hooks.
